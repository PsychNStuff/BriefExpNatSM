This is a repository for the syntaxes used for my undergraduate honors thesis titled "Effects of a brief exposure to nature or social media on psychological well-being" with analyses in SPSS and R. This is to, broadly, improve open science.

Most of my analyses were conducted in IBM SPSS 25. Variables were recoded and made into composite scores before analyses including descriptive statistics, correlations, a oneway ANOVA, Tukey's post hoc test, and moderation using PROCESS Macro (version 3.4.1) were conducted.
- Note that the code for PROCESS is not included here because the syntax is extremely long, but the tool to use it for SPSS, SAS, or R can be found at https://www.processmacro.org/download.html and the output to create graphs from PROCESS is included.

Bar graphs were completed using R (version 4.0.3), after the data was cleaned and the measures were created in SPSS. The code in R does not clean the data or aggregate any measures.

This is currently a preregistered project at https://osf.io/r68aj/ and will be updated with any citation(s) affiliated with it.
