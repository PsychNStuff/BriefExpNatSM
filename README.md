This is a repository for the syntaxes used for my undergraduate honors thesis titled "Effects of a brief exposure to nature or social media on psychological well-being" with analyses in SPSS and R. This is to, broadly, improve open science.

Most of my analyses were conducted in SPSS. Variables were recoded and made into composite scores before analyses including descriptive statistics, correlations, a oneway ANOVA, Tukey's post hoc test, and moderation using PROCESS Macro were conducted.
- Note that the code for PROCESS is not included here because the syntax is extremely long, but the tool to use it for SPSS, SAS, or R can be found at https://www.processmacro.org/download.html

Graphs, including bar graphs and interactions, were completed using R.
